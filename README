The following project has two executables.

Serial Version of the game 2048-Serial.cpp
Parallel version of the game 2048-Cuda.cu

To Run the Serial version of the game:
1: ./make

The serial version of the game can be played from a Linux terminal only because of ANSI color coded output.
2: ./2048-Serial

The parallel version needs the GPU Infrastructure and therefore cannot be just run on the Just terminal.

To Compile use the following command:

1: nvcc -arch=sm_35 -rdc=true 2048-Cuda.cu

2: Run 2048-Cuda.exe (our code was compiled on windows / you will get a relative executable ) 

For the latest version of the code :
