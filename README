The following project has two executables.

Serial Version of the game 2048-Serial.cpp
Parallel version of the game 2048-Cuda.cpp

To Run the game:
./make

The serial version of the game can be played from a Linux terminal only because of ANSI color coded output.
./2048-Serial

The parallel version needs the GPU Infrastructure and therefore cannot be just run on the Just terminal.
./2048-Cuda
